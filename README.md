CSE 412  |  Final Report

Vidhi Bhargava


## **Detailed Application Requirements**
For our application, we developed AutoCat, a car catalog website that can be used by first time car buyers who are not sure about what cars meet their preference. The purpose of this application is to allow the user to narrow their search for cars theyâ€™re interested in. The factors we have included in our application to help customers are: make/model, price, fuel type, number of doors, drive wheels, body style, safety and more. After deciding on a car best fit for themselves, our users can click on the link that will directly take them to purchase the car from the original supplier.

#### 4. Body Type: 
The body type drop down has 4 elements: Style, Drive, Door and Seats. Style is a dropdown with CUV, Hatchback, SUV and Sedan as options. Drive is a dropdown with AWD, FWD, and RWD as options. Users can select multiple options. Door and Seats are a slider where the user specifies the minimum value for each.

#### Style: 
This option allows for users to select cars that meet their style preferences. For example a family of 6 might look for only SUV or CUV cars since a Sedan or Hatchback may be too small.

#### Drive: 
This option allows for users to search for cars that fit their preference of drive type. For example, if a user lived in a climate where it snowed a lot, an AWD vehicle would be most suitable as their car.

Fuel type, Engine size, and Cylinders are all dropdowns where users can select multiple options. Safety, City MPG, Horsepower, and Highway MPG are all sliders where users specify either the minimum, or the minimum and the maximum. Engine location is a checkbox where users can select multiple options.
